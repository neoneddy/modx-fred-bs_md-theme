MODX FRED Bootstrap for Material Design Theme

This is a theme for the front end editor (FRED) for MODX .  It's very rough right now, I only have so much time to work on it.   I want to try and make it compataible with most of the components in material design for Bootstrap 4.

This is the first time I've built a theme for FRED, your milage will vary.

http://sherpa.himmdesign.com/  Where I'm currently working on it, eventually we should have an official public demo.

## Components working now
* Section - This is a full width block that will support photo and color backgrounds with color overlays or even gradients.
* Heading - Just a simple editable heading
* Image - This uses the Bootstrap 4 figure markup supporting size, cropping, and drop shadow
* Card - A directly editable card component that supports a photo, button, and descriptive text.
* Button - Button component with different priority levels as well as  block, label and link options
* Youtube Video - Embed a youtube video - there are issues with dragging this element from a small constrained space to a larger space.
* Font Awesome Icon - Select a font awesome icon, uses the Icon Editor extra.
* Layouts - I have planned 1 - 5 or 6 column layouts.
  * 3 Columns

## Partialy working or placeholder
* List Resources -  pdoResources based list builder using cards, ideally configurable for columns, mobile desktop, etc
* Carousel - Currently tryign to use bootstraps carousel, but fighting it currently.


## How to use 
Hopefully this works for everyone

* Install this fred theme
* Setup a template using material design for bootstrap in MODX
  * I supose we should try including that into the theme itself, but I'm not sure what  the legalities of that are.
